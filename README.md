## Getting and Cleaning Data Project

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. 

The final result, a tidy data set, is saved in `tidy.txt`.

The code book `CodeBook.md` describes the data, the variables, and the work performed to clean up the data.  

The script `run_analysis.R` performs the analysis.
